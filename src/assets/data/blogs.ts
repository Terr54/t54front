    "When was the last time you had Ginger, perhaps you don't now. Well but,when was the last time you had sausages and other spicy food? It is well possible that you had Nigeria ginger or at least a mix of it. * According to data by EUROSTAT, in 2019 the EU imported around 22,000 tonnes of Nigerian dried ginger, valued at around EUR 4.6 million.*Ginger farmers in Nigeria are generally individual smallholders, farming families, cooperatives and cottage firms.* As earlier noted, these farmers are mainly located in the northern and middle belt part of Nigeria where ginger is predominantly grown (i.e. in Kaduna, Nasarawa, Niger, Gombe, Bauchi, Benue and Plateau states). *The nation-wide total is largely unknown; the a anecdotal estimate provided by sector experts is that there are around 300,000 ginger farmers in Nigeria.* However according to a study by Synergos (2017), in Kaduna state alone there are about 21 ginger farming clusters and 353 sub-clusters across 10 local government areas, with a total of 62,952 ginger farmers. In 2016, about 60,803 ha of land area was cultivated by these farmers, with an output of 764,833 tonnes.* Studies indicate that more than 90 per cent of ginger farmers in Nigeria are smallholders cultivating less than 0.5 ha of land.* In Nigeria, dried split ginger production is mainly for commercial purposes, as only about 6 per cent of ginger farmers produce for local consumption.* Production of split dried ginger in Nigeria usually is labour-intensive and consists of processes such as land preparation, planting, weeding and harvesting. There are two main varieties of ginger grown in Nigeria: Tafin Giwa and Yatsun Biri.* According to the farmers, the Tafin Giwa variety has higher yields than Yatsun Biri and has a spicier flavour. Although Nigerian ginger farmers have a good understanding of the different varieties and input requirements, they have poor knowledge of good agricultural practices (GAP) for ginger farming, and this often leads to inefficient use of agricultural inputs (mainly fertilisers). Fertilisers and ginger buds are the two main inputs, usually purchased from local agro-input dealers in Nigeria.*",

    'Direct imports from Nigeria to Europe are not frequent. Direct sourcing by EU buyers from Nigeria is rare as Nigerian companies are not equipped with the necessary sterilisation machines. Therefore, the risk of mycotoxin (aflatoxin) contamination is high in Nigerian ginger.* This is the main reason why Nigerian ginger is imported as splits. Splits are easier to control than ground material. Grinding ginger is not easy to perform in Nigeria as there are a lot of food safety and operational issues (such as power outages or shortages). This is not very favourable for Nigerian producers as they do not add value through grinding.* One of the challenges raised by the interviewed EU buyers is that they are unable to find processors with good cutting equipment able to offer thin slices. Instead, Nigerian ginger is often processed in India or Vietnam. Indian companies often blend Nigerian and Indian ginger to make ginger less pungent.* At the moment Nigerian ginger is used more in markets where price is more important than taste. They noted the lack of accredited laboratories which are equipped for reliable testing many types of pesticide residues and other contaminants.* European companies commonly conduct product tests in Europe. Another issue is the business environment in Nigeria which in their view is currently unstable. As a result, some EU companies do not entirely feel financially and or even physically safe to work with Nigerian counterparts.* But we can help your company with that, most of the actors in the value chain from small holder farmers, processing companies, cooperatives, certification bodies, international testing agencieswe are in contact with, this enables us to integrate these actors all under one umbrella so we can help them get products that can meet quality demands internationally.* Contact us for more information.',

    'Ginger (Zingiber officcinale Roscoe) belongs to the family Zingiberaceae and is an important commercial crop grown for its aromatic rhizomes. It is one of the oldest and renowned commercial spices esteemed for its aroma, flavour and pungency. Spices are high value and export oriented crops, which play an important role in agricultural economy of the countries that grow them.* The bulk of the spices identified in Nigeria are found in the Southern rainforest zone of the country, while others such as garlic and ginger are found predominantly in the dry Northern zone. Nigerian farmers cultivate spices such as curry (Murrayakoenigii), sweet basil (Ocimumbasilicum), bush tea (Ocimumgratissimum), ginger(Zingiberofficinale), guinea pepper (Xylopiaaethiopica), African black pepper (Piper guineense) and turmeric(Curcuma longa).* Ginger and African black pepper are the major Nigerian spices in the international market, the rest are consumed locally. Black pepper is the largest traded spice worldwide, attracting the highest amount per ton, followed closely by chilli pepper.* Globally Nigeria has the 2nd largest production share of about 16% after india with a production share of 33.9%.* 28.4% of Nigerian Ginger is exported to India, Germany is the 2nd export destination of Nigerian Ginger, followed by the United Arab Emirates with 11.7%, then, 6.8% to The United States, 4.6%, Morocco, 4.29%, Vietnam, 3.97% to Saudi Arabia, The Netherlands on 7th with 3.35%, Egypt, 2.46%, South Africa, 2.1%, 1.91% to Yemen, Spain, 1.66%, France is 12th with 1.16%, Poland 0.82% Austria 0.76%, Russia, 0.71%, Brazil 0.56%* In 2020, direct imports of dried ginger from developing countries to Europe totalled 152 thousand tonnes. Since 2016, the import volume has increased by 8.5% annually. In that same period, the (direct) import values increased by more than 16% annually, totalling €310 million in 2020. In 2020, more than 70% of total imports to Europe were sourced directly from developing countries. Re-exports to Europe accounted for almost 30% of total imports in 2020.* In terms of regional production shares, Asia (84%) and Africa (15.2%) dominate global ginger production. Data from OEC shows that between 2017 and 2018 global export of ginger grew by 11.5 per cent, from USD 845 million to USD 942 million.*',
